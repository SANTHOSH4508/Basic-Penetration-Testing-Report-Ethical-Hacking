## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps to set it up on your computer.

### üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Software:** XAMPP (to set up the development environment)
- **Disk Space:** At least 200 MB of free space
- **Access:** Internet connection for downloading the files

### üíæ Installation Steps

1. **Download XAMPP:**
   - Get XAMPP from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   - Install it by following the prompts.

2. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Open the `htdocs` folder in your XAMPP installation directory.
   - Download the project files from the Releases page.
   - Move the downloaded files into the `htdocs` folder.

3. **Create the Database:**
   - Since there are no `.sql` files included, you will need to create the database manually.
   - Open phpMyAdmin at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - Create a new database with the name `tech_ecommerce`.
   - Manually add tables and data as per the specifications in the report.

## üîç Attack Summary

The report includes a detailed analysis of various attacks found during testing.

### ‚úÖ Successful Attacks

1. **SQL Injection:** This attack exploits vulnerabilities in the application's database logic.
2. **Data Tampering:** Unauthorized modifications of data occurred.
3. **Replay Attack:** Attackers could resend previous valid data.
4. **Brute Force:** Weak passwords were cracked by repeated guessing.
5. **Data Disclosure:** Sensitive information was exposed.
6. **Insider Attack:** Internal users misused their access rights.
7. **IDOR:** Insecure Direct Object Reference weaknesses were found.

### ‚ùå Unsuccessful Attacks

The report also covers attempts that did not succeed, providing insights into the application's strengths.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations

To safeguard your application, consider implementing these measures:

1. **Use Prepared Statements:** This helps prevent SQL injection attacks by separating SQL code from data.
2. **Implement Strong Password Policies:** Encourage complex passwords and consider multi-factor authentication.
3. **Validate User Input:** Always check and sanitize user inputs to prevent data tampering.
4. **Monitor User Activity:** Keep track of user actions to catch internal misuse early.
5. **Conduct Regular Security Audits:** Regular checks can identify new vulnerabilities over time.
